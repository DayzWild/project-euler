        <h1>Project Euler</h1>
        <p>Project Euler is a series of challenging mathematical/computer programming problems that will require more than just mathematical insights to solve. Although mathematics will help you arrive at elegant and efficient methods, the use of a computer and programming skills will be required to solve most problems.</p>

        <h2>Multiples of 3 or 5</h2>
        <p>If we list all the natural numbers below 10 that are multiples of 3 or 5, we get 3, 5, 6 and 9. The sum of these multiples is 23.</p>
        <p>Find the sum of all the multiples of 3 or 5 below 1000.</p>

        <h2>Even Fibonacci Numbers</h2>
        <p>Each new term in the Fibonacci sequence is generated by adding the previous two terms. By starting with 1 and 2, the first 10 terms will be:<br>
        1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89, ...</p>
        <p>By considering the terms in the Fibonacci sequence whose values do not exceed four million, find the sum of the even-valued terms.</p>
